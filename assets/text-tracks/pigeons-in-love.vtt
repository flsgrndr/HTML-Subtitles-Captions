00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.000
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
